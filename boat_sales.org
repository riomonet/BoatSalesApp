* Problem blurb 1:

- Need to sell boats. Any boat that is on land needs to be sold.
Need to sell salvage parts. Need to raise money for the Marina.
Marina doesn't make any money. Boats for sale take up space.
Boats sales can increase revenue for the Marina in a big way.

have to take pictures of boats, have to take videos of boats,
have do tours of the boats.
have to list prices and descriptions.

Year, make, model price, style


where are we:
what do we know:

- we have boats for sale

- we know some details about the boats, maybe not all the details

- we know a few sights where we can list the boats.

- we know we are gonna use postgresql

questions:

 - what is the layout of individual listings
 - what is the layout of all listings page.
 - do images have to be a certain side
 - when you click a listing how is a slide show presented
 - what is the relationship beteween the front and back end.
   ie: when

 - what tables are there in the database?
 - what queries are there in the database?
 - when someon clicks a listing
	- what gets queried?
	- does the front end talk to the back end using json?


 - what data are we returing from the database?
        Make, model, year, price, type, description, array of images(or image url's)
	with one chosen as the default
	
  Where are we going ?

 What do we need to know ?

	Research required *******
	Before I make any decisions I have to understand this.
 	I don't understand how images are served. what is stored in the datbase?
	a file ? or a path to a file? I assume images are stored in a folder on the server?

	what is res.static? what does that have to do with anythinG?

	options:
	 - send the image file its res.sendFile()
	 - create url or data url for each image. then just serve the html

Potenial Libraries:
	Multer - file upload middleware
